There will be a new file collection ("repository") for each class. 

The collection will include the presentation output (a PDF) and the source that produced it (an R markdown file with extension .Rmd). It will also contain any R script files I used or developed in class, and any datasets.

This week it also contains the advice on how to maintain a clean working environment in R between sessions.

I will try to make the files available before class, and will then update them after class. Some files will be created in class and will obviously not be available before.

You can simply download the files as you would any other. Or, if you really want, you can go all-in with Github, install Git and clone/branch/whatever the repository and work with them that way, but that really isn't my intention. To be honest I'm not a big Git/Github expert. I'm just using this system because it allows me to upload all the files at the push of a button, and then update them after class is over, which would be really painful to do using Blackboard.
